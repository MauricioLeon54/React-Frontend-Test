# Frontent Test React (frontent-test-react)

_Test React (Frontend)_

## Comments
In this project there is an "auto-complete component" that uses a public API to obtain the data only once, and then filters the results from the value of an input to then show the options. The original idea was to make requests every time the input value changed, but I didn't find a public API that would receive parameters and filter the data.

In this project I want to demonstrate my abilities, without a doubt I could not exploit them in the best way since time was limited and 3rd party libraries were prohibited.

In the "Search" folder all the files of the requested component will be found, as an extra, I did it in JS since it accommodates me a little more, but the TS file is still attached.

I hope you like it and I am more than open to listen to any questions or comments.
